Hello This is kapil

This is a very basic template to connect to MongoDB atlas free version

Using express & node.js

1. Dont forget to Create usermodel.js to give the schema
2. To create a MongoDB account on the Web App online
    i. Create a Project
    ii. Create a cluster & Database
    iii. Click on Connect -> Click on 1st Row 'Drivers' 
    iv. Copy that link to use in this code as a connection.

3. Note : IP whitelisting in the Network Access need to be done if the device of MongoDB account and the code we use is different.
4. Note : So if there are different devices using then in Database Access new devices need to be added as well.
